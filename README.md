# Mersenne-Primes

Simply put, this code will take a maximum integer (eg 10,000) and return a list of all the Mersenne primes within that range.

This was a 'trial by fire' learning excercise, I initially tried a one function approach but settled for a function to generate a list of primes, one for Mersenne 'numbers', then a simple list intersection function.
This is version 1 of my mersenne prime generator, I fully intend to continue development on this project.
